@government
go-to: menu

The Spanish Republic, called by some the "Second Republic", is a semipresidential republic with both a strong President and Parliment, called the Council of Deputies or the Cortes. The Cortes are responsible for governing, while the President partially ceremonial but also has some important governing powers and responsibilities.

The Cortes are elected based on a mixed representation system, giving bigger electoral lists in each electoral district more seats while making sure that the less voted lists are still represented. The President then elects a President of Council of Ministers, sometimes referred to as President of Goverment. The Cortes than vote on wether to accept the goverment or not. A majority vote-of-no-confidence can remove the current government.

The President is elected by a the Cortes and a equal number of delegates elected specifiaclly for the occasion. The role of the president is mostly to represent Spain, but he also has governing powers. The President can veto laws that are not voted by 2/3rds of the Cortes and send them back for one revision if they do have 2/3ds of the Cortes. The President of the Republic also chooses the President of Goverment and is able to dissolve the Cortes twice, and can thus influence the formation of a government, however, after the second use dissolution the newly formed Cortes must do a vote of confidence on the President of the Republic, if more than half of the Cortes reject the necesity of the dissolution the President must step down.

Spain is an integral nation, this means that while the majority of the country is unitarian, some states have autonomies each of which have their own governments with a number of responsibilities. While currently no autonomies have been approved it is known that the Catalans and Basque wish for one.
