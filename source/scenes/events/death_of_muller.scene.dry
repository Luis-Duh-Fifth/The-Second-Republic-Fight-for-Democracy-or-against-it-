Chancellor Hermann Prieto has died while in office. He will be greatly missed. But now, we must select a new Chancellor.

- @azana_chancellor: Manuel Azaña for Chancellor.
- @wels_chancellor: Otto Wels (PSOE) for Chancellor.
- @breitscheid_chancellor: Rudolf Breitscheid (PSOE) for Chancellor.
- @bruning_chancellor: Let Heinrich Bruning of the Center Party become Chancellor.

Indalecio Prieto, one of the PSOE's long-time leaders, has died. He will be greatly missed.
