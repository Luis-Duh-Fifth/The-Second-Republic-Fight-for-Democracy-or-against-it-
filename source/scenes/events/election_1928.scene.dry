Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

Somehow, both the Communists and Center are at the very least willing to entertain negotiations. Of course, PCE radicals and Center conservatives derail the negotiations almost immediately.

In response to the PCE's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The PCE has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that the Popular Front would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them.

In response to the PCE's entrance into the government, the right-wing immediately launches a coup attempt. Troops of the Stahlhelm and Nazi SA enter Berlin and immediately begin clashing with our supporters! Reactionary officers within the Reichswehr have taken their troops out of the barracks and joined them with the Stahlhelm to stop us from taking power.

The Center manages to diffuse some of the hostility from the Reichswehr and the Stahlhelm, but fail to prevent the outbreak of fighting. We are forced to fight on the same side as the PCE, whether we want to or not.

The reactionary establishment is still very skeptical of the Nazis, so instead, [+ president +] appoints Kurt von Schleicher, a former general, as chancellor, to try to "tame" the Nazis.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Cortes. Despite his support for a coalition with the FE_JONS, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

@far_right_azana

President Azaña faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so? Some, even on the left, suggest that the Nazis would not *truly* be as horrific as their platform suggests, and that giving them power would let them discredit themselves in the eyes of the public.

Alternatively, Azaña could use the emergency powers of the presidency. Article 48 has been used by Alcala Zamora to promulgate anti-democratic and anti-worker policies; can Article 48 be used for good as well as evil?

The PCE is still very reluctant to join a coalition, despite grassroots friendliness between our memberships. The Stalinist leadership is vehemently against such a thing. They demand the appointment of Ernst Thälmann as chancellor in exchange for a coalition. [? if president == "Alcala Zamora" : There is no chance whatsoever that President Alcala Zamora would approve of the appointment of a die-hard communist as chancellor. ?] Alternatively, if our relations with them are good enough, we could convince them to support the appointment of one of our centrist or left-leaning members as chancellor.

They expect that our government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The PCE has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" in the worker's government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side. They seem to expect that we would inevitably fail, and that our failure would benefit them. 

Whatever their reasoning is, the PSOE has control over the ministries of government.

Even though the CEDA is very reluctant to participate in such a coalition, given Hugenberg's anti-constitutional views, they still accede to President Alcala Zamora's wishes. Thus, a majority center-right coalition is formed, with Brüning as chancellor.

There is no path to a majority government. President Alcala Zamora is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of Brüning. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the PSOE votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

Alternatively, we could try to form a "new grand coalition" of all constitutional parties except the FE_JONS, PCE, and CEDA.

There is no path to a majority government. Alcala Zamora is displeased with Papen, and calls on him to resign. Now, former army general Kurt von Schleicher has been appointed chancellor, again as part of a presidential government.

By refusing to join the grand coalition or tolerating it, we essentially throw the balance of government to the right wing. [? if right_coalition >= 50 : There are enough votes to form a right-wing coalition that includes the CEDA. However, the CEDA leader, Hugenberg, is opposed to a coalition with the "November criminals" of the Center Party. And of course, the fe_jons is not interested in coalition government. This means that there will not be enough votes to form a majority coalition. ?][? if right_coalition < 50 : There are not enough votes to form a right-wing coalition that includes the CEDA, and they are not interested in joining in a coalition with the "November criminals" of the Center Party, anyhow. And of course, the fe_jons is not interested in coalition government. This means that there is no route to a majority coalition. ?]

If we do not at least "tolerate" the government, there will be new elections in a few months. In the meantime, the President and Chancellor may use the emergency powers granted by Article 48 of the constitution to essentially govern by decree. And it is not at all clear that we will do any better in the next election.

- @join_bruning: Join the Brüning coalition.
- @toleration_bruning: We will tolerate Brüning after all.

There is no path to a workable Cortes majority or minority government. The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The people's faith in democracy is shaken by this ordeal. Of course, the Nazis are exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

We have decided to tolerate Brüning's government. This means that we will vote against no-confidence votes to make sure they fail, but also that we will not be directly participating as ministers in the government. Thus, we can prevent a new election and stop the far right from entering government.

@grand_coalition_fail
on-arrival: grand_coalition_failed = 1

Unfortunately, the PRP and PNV are unwilling to enter into another coalition with the PSOE, so the grand coalition is unable to be formed.

- @no_majority: Thus, there is no clear majority.
- @azanas_dilemma
- @right_coalition: Perhaps a right-wing coalition may form.
- @beg_prp: Perhaps we could ask the PRP to change their minds?

@prp_majority
go-to: join_bruning

Under the influence of Gustav Stresemann, the PRP agrees to allow us into the coalition, and so does the PNV.


@prp_conservative

The PRP asks us to adhere to their conservative economic policies (that is, extreme austerity and labor discipline) in exchange for us joining the coalition.

- @beg_prp_2: But they would not have a majority without the PSOE! The CEDA and fe_jons have no interest in participating in government.
- @no_majority: There is no chance that we would agree.
- @azanas_dilemma
- @coalition_menu: What are the other governing arrangements?


@beg_prp_2
go-to: beg_prp_succeed; beg_prp_fail

We make the case that without the PSOE, there is no parliamentary majority, given the CEDA and FE_JONS's hostility to constitutional government.

@beg_prp_succeed
go-to: join_bruning

Somehow, we succeed in convincing them! We are now in a coalition.


@beg_prp_fail
go-to: no_majority

As expected, the PRP is too set in their anti-democratic ways.



@grand_coalition_psoe_lead
on-arrival: leverage -= 15 if prp_relation < 20

As expected, the PSOE is the largest party, and this time, we are expected to take the lead role in the formation of the next government, including selecting the chancellor. President [+ president +] has asked us to form a majority coalition with the Center (Z), Bavarian People's (PNV), Democratic (IR), and People's (PRP) parties.

[? if prp_relation < 20 : As our relation with the PRP is poor, they are demanding more minister posts in order to remain part of the coalition. ?]

Who should be the chancellor?

The Center party has significant qualms about appointing Azaña as chancellor, given that he is already Minister-President of Prussia. They ask for either more cabinet positions, or for Azaña to resign his state government role. The latter is completely unacceptable.

This is highly unexpected, and many in the left and center of our party are criticizing this decision.

Since Wilhelm Marx resigned, Heinrich Brüning has been appointed chancellor.

Are we sure about not participating in government? This will cause significant internal dissent, and will lead to increased distrust from the bourgeois parties. Even debating this option causes internal backlash. In addition, it is possible that the bourgeois and right-wing parties will also be unable to form a coalition government, leading to a regime appointed by President [+ president +].

There are enough votes to form a right-wing coalition of the Z, PRP, CEDA, and various minor parties, essentially replicating the previous Marx government. However, the CEDA is very reluctant to join the government[? if year <= 1928 : , as it had just exited from a coalition with the Center. ?][? if year > 1928 : , as its leader, Alfred Hugenberg, is against the very existence of parliamentary democracy, and is unwilling to join such a coalition anymore. ?]

Chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Center Party currently rules on an emergency basis, as part of a "presidential government". New elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]

Since the remaining bourgeois and right-wing parties cannot form a tolerable governing agreement, new elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]. The previous chancellor has resigned, and has been replaced by Heinrich Brüning, also of the Center Party, ruling as part of a presidential cabinet. 

We are seen as responsible for the failure to form a government, and many of our middle-class and even some working-class supporters have deserted the party.


@ministries

We can pick from any number of ministries. Controlling a ministry allows us to directly effect policy in that area. [? if in_left_front : Any ministry that we do not take will be given to the PCE. ?] [? if in_left_front and reichswehr_minister_party == "PCE" : If the PCE controls the Reichswehr Ministry, the army will most likely revolt. ?]
