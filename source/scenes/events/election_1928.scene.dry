Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

Could we really form a coalition that included both the Left Republicans and the Communists? It seems like an absurd concept, but given our good relationships with both sides, it is not an impossibility.

The far-right might attempt a coup, if such a coalition were formed.

- @popular_front_2: Form the Popular Front!

@popular_front_2

While the formation of a government is underway, questions of participation arise. Largo Caballero maintains that we should refuse to join the government, letting the Left Republicans form their own government alongside the Communists—in order not to compromise the socialist movement with bourgeois concessions. Prieto, on the other hand, argues that by participating directly in government, we can better resolve Spain's current problems.

- @popular_front_success: We will enter goverment and participate in it. We must defend the Republic from the Goverment.
- @popular_front_sucess_toleration: Let the left burgois form their goverment, we will await from below. We are in the perfect position to observe, defend, and perhaps even attack.

Somehow, surprisingly, the coalition is successfully formed! We still need a president of goverment; there are few acceptable choices for president of goverment among the parties. Eventually the list is narrowed down to Prieto, who faces strong rebuffs from Caballero, and Azana, the usual chancellor of the left goverments. Both are acceptable to the Left Republicans and Communists [? if president == "Alcala Zamora" : as well as President Alcala Zamora, albeit extremely reluctantly ?].

In response to the PCE's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The PCE has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries [? if toleration_azana = 1 : as do we ?]. [? if toleration_azana = 0 : They ?] [? if toleration_azana = 1 : We ?] claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting from the outside while also running their own extraparlamentary actions, be it campaigning or other less benign reasons.

There are enough votes for the Far Right and the CEDA to form a coalition. They are agitating for Gil Robles to be granted the Presidency of Goverment.

The Alcala Zamora is still very skeptical of the non Republicans, so instead, [+ president +] appoints Portela, a centrist Republican, as chancellor, to try to "tame" the strengthen the Republican center.

Portela's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Cortes. Despite his support for a coalition with all Republican parties, the Cortes do not seem amicable to him.

A no confidence vote is called on Portela, which he fails to survive, the President dissolves the courts and calls new elections.

@far_right_azana

President Azana faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so? Some, even on the left republicans, suggest that the CEDA would not *truly* be planning on a restoration, and that giving them power would let them discredit themselves in the eyes of the public.

Alternatively, Azana could use the emergency powers of the presidency. Though many wonder if such a move is democratic, or if it will genuenly do anything to stop the CEDA.

- @emergency_azana: We will form an emergency government with Azana's support.
- @new_elections: We will have new elections.

There is no path to a majority government. President Alcala Zamora is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of Brüning. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the PSOE votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

There is no path to a majority government. One option would be to have a continuation of the current Brüning government; if we tolerate it, then it would retain a majority vote against no-confidence.

Alternatively, we could try to form a "new grand coalition" of all constitutional parties except the FE_JONS, PCE, and CEDA. The stumbling block are the minor conservative parties such as the "Economic Party of the Middle Class", who detest any hint of socialism and would ruin the country before working with Marxists.

The third option is to have new elections.

There is no path to a majority government. Alcala Zamora is displeased with Portela, and calls on him to resign. Now, conservative republican Miguel Maura has been appointed President of Goverment, again as part of a presidential government.

There is no path to a workable Cortes majority or minority government. The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The people's faith in democracy is shaken by this ordeal. Of course, the CEDA amd far rogjt are exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Spain needs a strong leader.

We have decided to tolerate the rightist Republican government. This means that we will vote against no-confidence votes to make sure they fail, but also that we will not be directly participating as ministers in the government. Thus, we can prevent a new election and stop the far right from entering government.

@grand_coalition_fail
on-arrival: grand_coalition_failed = 1

Unfortunately, the PRP and PRR are unwilling to enter into another coalition with the PSOE, so the grand coalition is unable to be formed.

@prp_majority
go-to: join_bruning

Under the influence of Gustav Stresemann, the PRP agrees to allow us into the coalition, and so does the PNV.


@prp_conservative

The PRR asks us to adhere to their conservative economic policies (that is, austerity and labor discipline) in exchange for us joining the coalition.

- @beg_prp_2: But they would not have a majority without the PSOE! The CEDA and far right have no interest in participating in government.
- @no_majority: There is no chance that we would agree.
- @azanas_dilemma: Perhaps Azana can do something?
- @coalition_menu: What are the other governing arrangements?


@beg_prp_2
go-to: beg_prp_succeed; beg_prp_fail

We make the case that without the PSOE, there is no parliamentary majority, given the CEDA and Far Right's hostility to constitutional government.

@beg_prp_succeed

Somehow, we succeed in convincing them! We are now in a coalition.


@beg_prp_fail

As expected, the PRP is too set in their anti-socialist ways.

on-arrival: leverage -= 15 if prp_relation < 20

As expected, the PSOE is the largest party, and this time, we are expected to take the lead role in the formation of the next government, including selecting the chancellor. President [+ president +] has asked us to form a majority coalition with the Center (Z), Bavarian People's (PNV), Democratic (IR), and People's (PRP) parties.

[? if prp_relation < 20 : As our relation with the PRP is poor, they are demanding more minister posts in order to remain part of the coalition. ?]

Who should be the chancellor?

This is highly unexpected, and many in the left and center of our party are criticizing this decision.

Since Lerroux is desliked by the left, Martinez Barrios has been appointed chancellor.

Are we sure about not participating in government? This will cause significant internal dissent, and will lead to increased distrust from the bourgeois parties. Even debating this option causes internal backlash. In addition, it is possible that the bourgeois and right-wing parties will also be unable to form a coalition government, leading to a regime appointed by President [+ president +].

There are enough votes to form a right-wing coalition of the PRR, PRP, CEDA, and various minor parties, essentially forming a Right Wing Goverment. However, the CEDA is very reluctant to join the government.

President of Goverment Lerroux of the Radical Republlican Party currently rules on a Right Wing Coalition.

Since the remaining bourgeois and right-wing parties cannot form a tolerable governing agreement, new elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]. The previous President of Goverment has resigned, and has been replaced by Manuel Portela, a liberal Independant, ruling as part of a presidential cabinet. 

We are seen as responsible for the failure to form a government, and many of our middle-class and even some working-class supporters have deserted the party.
