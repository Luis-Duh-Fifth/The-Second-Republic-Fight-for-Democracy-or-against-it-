Since we are currently ruling as part of an emergency government, we may use quasi-constitutional trickery to significantly delay these elections, and continue governing via Article 48. This is likely to be extremely unpopular both with our base and with the other parties. However, this may be necessary to prevent the extremists from gaining power.

In response to the PCE's entrance into the government, the right-wing takes a "wait-and-see" approach for now. They expect that the Popular Front government will be unstable and incompetent, and will collapse of its own accord, discrediting the left and center and eventually enabling the destruction of the Weimar Republic. Our task is to prove them wrong.

The PCE has taken an abstentionist position with regards to ministries. They claim to be participating as the "loyal opposition" within the Popular Front government, supporting us from the outside while also running their own propaganda campaigns to turn workers to their side.

The reactionary establishment is still very skeptical of the Nazis, so instead, [+ president +] appoints Kurt von Schleicher, a former general, as chancellor, to try to "tame" the Nazis.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Reichstag. Despite his support for a coalition with the FE_JONS, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

@far_right_braun

President Braun faces a dilemma. Is it "democratic" to let democracy be destroyed, if the majority of voters have willed it so? Some, even on the left, suggest that the Nazis would not *truly* be as horrific as their platform suggests, and that giving them power would let them discredit themselves in the eyes of the public.

Alternatively, Braun could use the emergency powers of the presidency. Article 48 has been used by Hindenburg to promulgate anti-democratic and anti-worker policies; can Article 48 be used for good as well as evil?

However, the CEDA and its leader Hugenberg is refusing to partake in a coalition with the "November criminals" in the Center Party. Thus, there is no clear path towards a Reichstag majority.

Even though the CEDA is very reluctant to participate in such a coalition, given Hugenberg's anti-constitutional views, they still accede to President Hindenburg's wishes. Thus, a majority center-right coalition is formed, with Brüning as chancellor.

There is no path to a majority government. President Hindenburg is tired of the chaos, and appoints Franz von Papen as chancellor instead of Brüning. Papen is a indenpendent formerly from the Center Party, and is significantly to the right of the majority of the Center Party.

Papen is immediately faced with a vote of no confidence, given his unpopularity. However the PSOE votes, he is guaranteed to fall, due to the unanimous hatred against him from all other parties.

There is no path to a majority government. One option would be to have a continuation of the current Brüning government; if we tolerate it, then it would retain a majority vote against no-confidence.

Alternatively, we could try to form a "new grand coalition" of all constitutional parties except the FE_JONS, PCE, and CEDA. The stumbling block are the minor conservative parties such as the "Economic Party of the Middle Class", who detest any hint of socialism and would ruin the country before working with Marxists.

The third option is to have new elections.

There is no path to a majority government. Hindenburg is displeased with Papen, and calls on him to resign. Now, former army general Kurt von Schleicher has been appointed chancellor, again as part of a presidential government.

Schleicher's government is deeply unpopular among all parties of the Reichstag. Despite his support for a coalition with the FE_JONS, the Nazis want power all to themselves, without Schleicher.

There is no path to a workable Reichstag majority or minority government. The next elections are set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

The people's faith in democracy is shaken by this ordeal. Of course, the Nazis are exploiting the instability to claim that democracy is unworkable, and that Germany needs a strong leader.

We have decided to tolerate Brüning's government. This means that we will vote against no-confidence votes to make sure they fail, but also that we will not be directly participating as ministers in the government. Thus, we can prevent a new election and stop the far right from entering government.

@grand_coalition_fail

Unfortunately, the PRP and PNV are unwilling to enter into another coalition with the PSOE, so the grand coalition is unable to be formed.

@prp_majority

Under the influence of Gustav Stresemann, the PRP agrees to allow us into the coalition, and so does the PNV.


@prp_conservative

The PRP asks us to adhere to their conservative economic policies (that is, extreme austerity and labor discipline) in exchange for us joining the coalition.

- @beg_prp_2: But they would not have a majority without the PSOE! The CEDA and fe_jons have no interest in participating in government.

@beg_prp_2

We make the case that without the PSOE, there is no parliamentary majority, given the CEDA and FE_JONS's hostility to constitutional government.

@beg_prp_succeed

Somehow, we succeed in convincing them! We are now in a coalition.

As expected, the PRP is too set in their anti-democratic ways.

As expected, the PSOE is the largest party, and this time, we are expected to take the lead role in the formation of the next government, including selecting the chancellor. President [+ president +] has asked us to form a majority coalition with the Center (Z), Bavarian People's (PNV), Democratic (IR), and People's (PRP) parties.

[? if prp_relation < 20 : As our relation with the PRP is poor, they are demanding more minister posts in order to remain part of the coalition. ?]

Are we sure about not participating in government? This will cause significant internal dissent, and will lead to increased distrust from the bourgeois parties. Even debating this option causes internal backlash. In addition, it is possible that the bourgeois and right-wing parties will also be unable to form a coalition government, leading to a regime appointed by President [+ president +].

There are enough votes to form a right-wing coalition of the Z, PRP, CEDA, and various minor parties, essentially replicating the previous Marx government. However, the CEDA is very reluctant to join the government[? if year <= 1928 : , as it had just exited from a coalition with the Center. ?][? if year > 1928 : , as its leader, Alfred Hugenberg, is against the very existence of parliamentary democracy, and is unwilling to join such a coalition anymore. ?]

Chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Center Party currently rules on an emergency basis, as part of a "presidential government". New elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]

Since the remaining bourgeois and right-wing parties cannot form a tolerable governing agreement, new elections have been called for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +]. The previous chancellor has resigned, and has been replaced by Heinrich Brüning, also of the Center Party, ruling as part of a presidential cabinet. 

We are seen as responsible for the failure to form a government, and many of our middle-class and even some working-class supporters have deserted the party.

We can pick from any number of ministries. Controlling a ministry allows us to directly effect policy in that area.
