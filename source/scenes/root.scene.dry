> *"Such a general development cannot be attributed to the false tactics of any single party or to the mistakes of individual leaders. On the contrary, the conduct of individual leaders is determined largely by the sentiments of the people as a whole. It would be erroneous, however, to regard the sentiments of the moment as reflecting the natural make-up and character of the people. They are merely the consequence of the special circumstances which have brought about this profound degradation of the entire nation."*

It is a bright time for Spanish democracy. After a period of struggle, the new constitution has been approved, the first elections are being called. Economically, the situation leaves for better, however, now we can attempt to reform it, especially our disfunctional agrarian sector. In foreign policy, we must strive to get more recognition and support from forign goverments, many who see us with suspicion. 

Now, the task of the Left Republicans, from revolutionaries to liberals, is to prepare for the next election. Our provisional goverment coalition has passed the first fully democratic constitution, and we stand to gain. Perhaps the next government will have a left majority.
