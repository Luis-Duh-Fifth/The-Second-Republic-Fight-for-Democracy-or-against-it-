= Campaigning

Whether or not we are in an electoral campaign, the party is always trying to broaden its voter base. Who should we focus our campaign efforts on?

- @workers: The urban working class, our traditional support base.
- @new_middle: The "new middle class" of government employees and white-collar workers.
- @landholders: The "rural landholders" of small independent landowning peasents.
- @rural: Rural workers and small farmers, who have felt neglected by us in the past.
- @unemployed: The unemployed.
- @catholics: Catholics, who typically support the Center Party.
- @root: We either don't want to or cannot campaign right now.
- @easy_discard

We have increased our campaigning among the new middle class. [? if socialism <= 49 and peoples_party == 0: The popular antipathy towards socialism among this group makes our campaign more difficult. ?] [? if peoples_party > 0: As a people's party, we have an easier time increasing support among the middle class than before. ?]
